# Individual Project #1: Rust API Microservice
Build a useful API server in the domain of data engineering or machine learning engineering.

## Week 1 Progress

In this week, I learned some basics of Rust and the usage of Rust Project Template (from https://github.com/nogibjj/rust-new-project-template), and I gained some hands-on experience on building my first Rust project --to make an API server

### Usage
> Run `make run` in the terminal, it will launch a server.

> Run `curl -v http://localhost:8000/api/health` to get the JSON response.
