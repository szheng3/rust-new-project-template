# Weekly Rust Progress Report
Build a rust the domain of data engineering or machine learning engineering.

## Week 1 Progress

This week, I familiarized myself with the basics of Rust and gained hands-on experience by using the Rust Project Template (from https://github.com/nogibjj/rust-new-project-template). My first Rust project was building an API server, which provided a great opportunity for practical application of my newfound knowledge.
```

#[get("/api/health")]
async fn api_health_handler() -> HttpResponse {
    let response_json = &GenericResponse {
        status: "success".to_string(),
        message: "Health Check".to_string(),
    };
    HttpResponse::Ok().json(response_json)
}
```
### Usage

> Go to week1 `cd week1` 

> Run `make run` in the terminal, it will launch a server.

> Run `curl -v http://localhost:8000/api/health` to get the JSON response.


## Week 2 Progress

This week, I set up a GitHub CI/CD action pipeline for building, linking, and testing. Additionally, I utilized a Dockerfile to package my Rust services. Furthermore, I deployed the service on Google Cloud Platform using Kubernetes. You can access a demo of the setup at https://apiv2.sszzz.me.
> file is located at `.github/workflows`

Here is one of the code snippet from the CI/CD pipeline.
```
name: Rust

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

env:
  CARGO_TERM_COLOR: always

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Build
      run: cargo build --verbose
    - name: Run tests
      run: cargo test --verbose
```

## Week 3 Progress
This week, I set up a rust bench. In order to test the performance of the Rust, I write a single fibonacci sequence. The result is shown below.

```
pub fn fibonacci(n: u32) -> u32 {
    if n <= 1 {
        return n;
    }
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}
```

### Usage
> Go to week1 `cd week3`

> Run `make bench` in the terminal, it will run the benchmark test for fibonacci.
